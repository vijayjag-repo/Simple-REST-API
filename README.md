# Simple REST API

RESTful is not just limited to HTTP but since it is one of the significant differences, we must go from Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete -> POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE.


## What I used for the *famed four*

* Node.js
* mongoose instead of native driver for mongoDB
* Robo 3T - Interactive GUI for MongoDB. Just to focus on *famed four* + PATCH
* Postman - Testing out the *famed four* + PATCH
